# CC

CC (for carbon copy) is a tool that is designed to keep Gen Z aware and up to date of what is happening in their own life, their own social groups and what they want to do.

Our submission for Elevenlabs and LFH Hackathon.

## Always know What's Happening

CC stays up to date with messages you'd rather not spend time catching up on so that you can keep up to date with everything that is happening in your own social life.

## How to use?

1. Live life
2. Open CC and see What's Happening?
3. Read up and listen to everything.
